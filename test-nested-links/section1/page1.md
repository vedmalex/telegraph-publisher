# Page 1 in Section 1

This page contains relative links to test our link resolution system.

## Links to same directory
- [Page 2 in same section](page2.md)

## Links to parent directory
- [Main Index](../index.md)

## Links to sibling directory
- [Page 1 in Section 2](../section2/page1.md)
- [Page 2 in Section 2](../section2/page2.md)

## Links with complex paths
- [Complex path link](../section2/../section1/page2.md)

This tests how our system handles relative links across nested folder structures.

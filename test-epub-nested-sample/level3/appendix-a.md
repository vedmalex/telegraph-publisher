# Appendix A: Reference Notes

This appendix is a third-level dependency, referenced from multiple
chapters at different levels.

It should appear near the end of the EPUB, after the main layered
content, and all links to it should be rewritten to the correct
chapter-N.html target.

Back-links:

- [Root Index](../index.md)
- [Chapter 2 – Section B](../level1/chapter-2.md#chapter-2-section-b)

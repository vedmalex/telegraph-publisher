## Phase Decision Cross-References

### VAN → Implementation Mappings
- **[VAN: Core Issue Identified]** → **[IMPL: Conditional Logic Change]** → **[TEST: Multi-level Dependency Validation]**
- **[VAN: Simple Complexity Classification]** → **[IMPL: Single File Modification]** → **[TEST: Focused Test Strategy]**
- **[VAN: Fast-track Recommendation]** → **[IMPL: Direct to Implementation Phase]** → **[TEST: Comprehensive Coverage]**

### User Requirements → Design Decisions
- **[USER: Fix dependency bug]** → **[DESIGN: Global config condition]** → **[CODE: Enhanced conditional check]**
- **[USER: Unified pipeline]** → **[DESIGN: Consistent processing]** → **[CODE: Same logic in both methods]**
- **[USER: Maintain recursion prevention]** → **[DESIGN: Preserve existing logic]** → **[CODE: No changes to withDependencies usage]**

## Validation Checkpoints

### Implementation Validation
- [ ] **publishWithMetadata**: Conditional logic modified to use global config
- [ ] **editWithMetadata**: Same logic applied for consistency
- [ ] **Performance**: localLinks.length check added
- [ ] **Recursion**: withDependencies logic preserved

### Testing Validation
- [ ] **Multi-level Structure**: root.md → dependency.md → sub-dependency.md
- [ ] **Link Replacement**: Telegraph URLs in dependency content verified
- [ ] **Configuration**: replaceLinksinContent setting respected
- [ ] **Regression**: Existing functionality maintained

### Quality Assurance Validation
- [ ] **AC1**: All files processed through unified pipeline
- [ ] **AC2**: Root file publishing fixes dependency links
- [ ] **AC3**: Recursion prevention mechanism intact
- [ ] **Coverage**: 100% test success rate achieved

# TASK-003: Unified Publication Pipeline

## Overview
**Task ID:** 2025-08-06_TASK-003_unified-publication-pipeline
**Created:** 2025-08-06_15-16
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ ACTIVE - ANALYSIS

## Objective
Fix the critical bug in the publication pipeline where link replacement is skipped for dependency files. The root cause is that link replacement is incorrectly tied to the `withDependencies` flag used for recursion control. Implement a unified pipeline that ensures all files (root and dependencies) go through the same processing steps.

## Problem Statement
When publishing a root file that has dependencies, the links within dependency files are not being replaced with Telegraph URLs before publication. This happens because the link replacement logic is controlled by the `withDependencies` flag, which is set to `false` for dependencies to prevent infinite recursion, inadvertently disabling link replacement.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All files processed through `publishWithMetadata` and `editWithMetadata` have their links replaced if `replaceLinksinContent` is enabled
- [ ] Publishing a root file results in correct link replacement within its dependencies
- [ ] Recursion prevention mechanism remains intact
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for the multi-level dependency scenario

## Current Phase
**QA Phase** - Fixing failing tests and performing quality assurance validation

## Dependencies
- `src/publisher/EnhancedTelegraphPublisher.ts` - Primary file to be modified
- Existing test infrastructure for validation

## Notes
- User provided comprehensive technical specification with VAN, PLAN, CREATIVE, and TECH_SPEC phases
- Solution involves decoupling link replacement from recursion control flag
- Testing plan requires multi-level dependency structure validation

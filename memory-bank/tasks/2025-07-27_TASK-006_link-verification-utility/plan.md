## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
```
src/links/
â”œâ”€â”€ LinkScanner.ts              # File discovery and link extraction
â”œâ”€â”€ LinkScanner.test.ts         # Unit tests for LinkScanner
â”œâ”€â”€ LinkVerifier.ts             # Link existence verification
â”œâ”€â”€ LinkVerifier.test.ts        # Unit tests for LinkVerifier
â”œâ”€â”€ LinkResolver.ts             # Intelligent fix suggestions
â”œâ”€â”€ LinkResolver.test.ts        # Unit tests for LinkResolver
â”œâ”€â”€ InteractiveRepairer.ts      # User interaction and fix application
â”œâ”€â”€ InteractiveRepairer.test.ts # Unit tests for InteractiveRepairer
â”œâ”€â”€ ReportGenerator.ts          # Output formatting
â”œâ”€â”€ ReportGenerator.test.ts     # Unit tests for ReportGenerator
â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts                    # Type definitions
â””â”€â”€ index.ts                    # Public API exports
```

### Key Interfaces
```typescript
interface BrokenLink {
  filePath: string;
  linkText: string;
  originalPath: string;
  lineNumber: number;
  suggestions: string[];
}

interface ScanResult {
  totalFiles: number;
  totalLinks: number;
  brokenLinks: BrokenLink[];
  processingTime: number;
}
```

### CLI Command Structure
```bash
telegraph-publisher check-links [path]
  --apply-fixes     # Enable interactive fix mode
  --dry-run         # Report only (default)
  --verbose         # Detailed progress output

# Usage patterns (consistent with publish/reset commands):
telegraph-publisher check-links                    # Current directory (recursive)
telegraph-publisher check-links ./docs            # Specific directory (recursive)
telegraph-publisher check-links ./docs/readme.md  # Single file
```

### Success Criteria Mapping
- **Functional Requirements**: All items in sections 2-4 address core functionality
- **CLI Integration**: Section 3 covers seamless integration with existing system
- **Interactive Features**: Section 4 implements user interaction requirements
- **Quality Standards**: Section 5 ensures 85% coverage and comprehensive testing

## Next Actions
1. **Complete Component Architecture Design** (1.1.1 - 1.1.6)
2. **Define API Contracts** (1.2.1 - 1.2.3)
3. **Plan File Organization** (1.3.1 - 1.3.2)
4. **Begin Core Implementation** starting with LinkScanner

## Validation Checkpoints

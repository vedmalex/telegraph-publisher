## 1. Cache Infrastructure Enhancement 🟢 Completed
Enhance caching mechanisms to support timestamp-based validation for optimal performance.

### 1.1 AnchorCacheEntry Interface Extension 🟢 Completed
   #### 1.1.1 Add mtime field to AnchorCacheEntry interface 🟢 Completed - `src/cache/AnchorCacheManager.ts:7-11`
   #### 1.1.2 Update AnchorCacheData versioning for compatibility 🟢 Completed - `src/cache/AnchorCacheManager.ts:35`
   #### 1.1.3 Implement backward compatibility for existing cache files 🟢 Completed - `migrateFromV11` method

### 1.2 AnchorCacheManager Timestamp Logic 🟢 Completed
   #### 1.2.1 Modify getAnchorsIfValid to check mtime first 🟢 Completed - Two-stage validation implemented
   #### 1.2.2 Update getAnchorsIfValid to use conditional hash calculation 🟢 Completed - Timestamp-first approach active
   #### 1.2.3 Enhance updateAnchors to store current file mtime 🟢 Completed - mtime storage with fallback
   #### 1.2.4 Add timestamp validation reason codes 🟢 Completed - 'timestamp-changed' reason added

---

## 2. Core Change Detection Refactoring 🟢 Completed
Implement two-factor change detection (timestamp + hash) in main publisher logic.

### 2.1 Publisher Change Detection Logic 🟢 Completed
   #### 2.1.1 Locate and analyze current change detection in editWithMetadata 🟢 Completed - Logic identified and analyzed
   #### 2.1.2 Implement timestamp-first validation logic 🟢 Completed - Two-stage validation with timestamp check
   #### 2.1.3 Add conditional hash calculation based on mtime changes 🟢 Completed - Hash only calculated when timestamp differs
   #### 2.1.4 Update metadata timestamp on successful publication 🟢 Completed - publishedAt already updated correctly

### 2.2 Metadata Enhancement 🟢 Completed
   #### 2.2.1 Verify publishedAt field usage for timestamp reference 🟢 Completed - Confirmed working correctly
   #### 2.2.2 Ensure consistent timestamp updates across publication flow 🟢 Completed - Verified in editWithMetadata

---

## 3. Force Flag Propagation Fix 🟢 Completed  
Ensure --force flag correctly bypasses all validation for target and dependencies.

### 3.1 CLI to Workflow Flag Mapping 🟢 Completed
   #### 3.1.1 Verify --force flag propagation in PublicationWorkflowManager 🟢 Completed - Already working correctly
   #### 3.1.2 Validate force option mapping to forceRepublish parameter 🟢 Completed - Mapping confirmed functional

### 3.2 Dependency Processing Force Logic 🟢 Completed
   #### 3.2.1 Fix hardcoded forceRepublish in handlePublishedFile 🟢 Completed - Changed to use recursiveOptions.force  
   #### 3.2.2 Implement force flag propagation in publishDependencies loop 🟢 Completed - Direct force handling implemented
   #### 3.2.3 Ensure force bypasses all timestamp and hash validation 🟢 Completed - Force overrides implemented

---

## 4. Comprehensive Testing Strategy 🟢 Completed
Develop and implement comprehensive test coverage for all change detection scenarios.

### 4.1 Unit Test Development 🟢 Completed
   #### 4.1.1 Create tests for timestamp-based change detection 🟢 Completed - AnchorCacheManager.test.ts (10 tests)
   #### 4.1.2 Create tests for hash-based change validation 🟢 Completed - Integrated in AnchorCacheManager tests
   #### 4.1.3 Create tests for force flag bypassing all validation 🟢 Completed - EnhancedTelegraphPublisher.basic.test.ts
   #### 4.1.4 Create tests for dependency force propagation 🟢 Completed - Force propagation mechanics validated

### 4.2 Integration Test Coverage 🟢 Completed
   #### 4.2.1 Test unchanged file detection with same mtime and hash 🟢 Completed - Basic functionality tests
   #### 4.2.2 Test modified file detection with changed mtime but same hash 🟢 Completed - Timestamp change detection validated
   #### 4.2.3 Test modified file detection with changed mtime and hash 🟢 Completed - Real file modification tests
   #### 4.2.4 Test force flag with unchanged target and dependencies 🟢 Completed - Force flag mechanics validated

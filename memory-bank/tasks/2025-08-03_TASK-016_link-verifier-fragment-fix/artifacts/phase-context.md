# Integrated Phase Context - Link Verifier Fragment Fix

## User Specifications Summary
- Source: artifacts/specs/requirements.md (comprehensive technical specification)
- Key Requirements: Fix LinkVerifier to handle URL fragments correctly
- Constraints: Must maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Current Phase Objectives
- Phase: PLAN ✅ COMPLETE
- Goals: Create detailed implementation plan with hierarchical task breakdown ✅ ACHIEVED
- Success Criteria: Comprehensive plan with clear milestones and success metrics ✅ ACHIEVED

## Previous Phase Results
- **VAN Analysis**: ✅ COMPLETE - Problem analyzed, root cause identified, solution strategy confirmed

## VAN Analysis Results
- **Problem Confirmed**: LinkVerifier doesn't handle file-path-with-fragment links (`./file.md#section`)
- **Root Cause Identified**: `verifyLinks` method passes full href including fragment to path resolution
- **Solution Strategy**: Pre-process href to strip fragment before path resolution
- **Implementation Target**: Single method modification in `verifyLinks` (lines 30-41)
- **Risk Assessment**: Low risk, surgical change, no regression potential

## Key Technical Requirements
1. **Core Fix**: Modify `src/links/LinkVerifier.ts` to strip URL fragments before file existence check
2. **Method Target**: `verifyLinks` method needs adjustment in the main loop
3. **Fragment Handling**: Split `link.href` by `#` and use only the file path part
4. **Edge Case**: Handle hrefs that are only fragments (empty file path)
5. **Testing**: Add comprehensive tests to `src/links/LinkVerifier.test.ts`

## Implementation Strategy
- **File Modification**: Single file change in LinkVerifier.ts
- **Test Addition**: New test cases for fragment handling
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing functionality remains intact
- **Validation**: Test with real-world scenarios including user's use case

## Success Validation
- Links with fragments correctly identified as valid when file exists
- Links with fragments to non-existent files still flagged as broken
- No regression in existing link verification functionality
- 100% test coverage for new functionality

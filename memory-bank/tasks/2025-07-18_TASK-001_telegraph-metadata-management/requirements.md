# Requirements - Telegraph Metadata Management System

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Metadata Injection and Management
**Priority**: High
**Description**: System must automatically add publication metadata to the beginning of each published file.

**Detailed Requirements**:
- **FR-1.1**: Metadata must include Telegraph URL, edit key, username, and publication timestamp
- **FR-1.2**: Metadata format must be parseable and human-readable
- **FR-1.3**: Metadata must be injected at the very beginning of the file
- **FR-1.4**: System must preserve existing content when adding metadata
- **FR-1.5**: Metadata must be updateable when file is republished

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Published files contain complete metadata at beginning
- [ ] Metadata format is consistent across all files
- [ ] Existing content remains unchanged after metadata injection
- [ ] Metadata can be parsed programmatically
- [ ] Updates to metadata preserve file integrity

### FR-2: Smart Publishing Logic
**Priority**: High
**Description**: System must determine publication status and choose appropriate action (create vs edit).

**Detailed Requirements**:
- **FR-2.1**: If file has no metadata → use createPage() and inject new metadata
- **FR-2.2**: If file has valid metadata → use editPage() with existing path/key
- **FR-2.3**: If metadata is corrupted → prompt user for action or auto-fix
- **FR-2.4**: System must validate metadata integrity before publishing
- **FR-2.5**: Publication status must be clearly communicated to user

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] New files are published using createPage()
- [ ] Previously published files are updated using editPage()
- [ ] Corrupted metadata is detected and handled appropriately
- [ ] User receives clear feedback on publication status
- [ ] No duplicate publications for same file

### FR-3: User Information Management
**Priority**: Medium
**Description**: System must save and use username during publication process.

**Detailed Requirements**:
- **FR-3.1**: Username must be stored in metadata for each published file
- **FR-3.2**: Username should be configurable per project or globally
- **FR-3.3**: Username must be included in Telegraph publication parameters
- **FR-3.4**: System must support multiple users/authors
- **FR-3.5**: Username must be preserved across republications

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Username is correctly stored in file metadata
- [ ] Username appears in Telegraph publication
- [ ] Username configuration is persistent
- [ ] Multiple authors can be supported
- [ ] Username remains consistent across updates

### FR-4: Local Link Detection and Resolution
**Priority**: High
**Description**: System must find local file references and automatically handle their publication.

**Detailed Requirements**:
- **FR-4.1**: Detect markdown links pointing to local files (`[text](./path/file.md)`)
- **FR-4.2**: Support relative path resolution from current file location
- **FR-4.3**: Validate that linked files exist and are accessible
- **FR-4.4**: Handle various link formats (relative, absolute within project)
- **FR-4.5**: Support nested directory structures

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All local markdown links are detected correctly
- [ ] Relative paths are resolved to absolute paths
- [ ] Non-existent linked files are reported as errors
- [ ] Different link formats are supported
- [ ] Nested directory links work correctly

### FR-5: Automatic Referenced File Publishing
**Priority**: High
**Description**: System must automatically publish referenced local files that haven't been published yet.

**Detailed Requirements**:
- **FR-5.1**: Check publication status of each referenced file
- **FR-5.2**: If not published → automatically publish the referenced file first
- **FR-5.3**: If already published → use existing Telegraph URL
- **FR-5.4**: Handle recursive dependencies (files referencing other files)
- **FR-5.5**: Detect and prevent circular dependencies

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Unpublished referenced files are automatically published
- [ ] Published referenced files are not republished unnecessarily
- [ ] Recursive dependencies are handled correctly
- [ ] Circular dependencies are detected and prevented
- [ ] Publication order respects dependency chain

### FR-6: Link Replacement for Publication
**Priority**: High
**Description**: System must replace local links with Telegraph URLs only in published content, not source files.

**Detailed Requirements**:
- **FR-6.1**: Replace local links with Telegraph URLs only during publishing
- **FR-6.2**: Source files must remain completely unchanged
- **FR-6.3**: Link text and formatting must be preserved
- **FR-6.4**: Handle complex link structures (with titles, references)
- **FR-6.5**: Ensure replaced links are valid and accessible

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Local links are replaced with Telegraph URLs in published content
- [ ] Source files show no modifications after publishing
- [ ] Link text and formatting are preserved
- [ ] Complex link structures work correctly
- [ ] All replaced links are functional

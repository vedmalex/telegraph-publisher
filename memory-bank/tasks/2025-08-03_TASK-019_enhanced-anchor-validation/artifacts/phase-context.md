# Integrated Phase Context - Enhanced Anchor Validation and Reporting

## User Specifications Summary
- **Source**: Technical specification provided by user in `artifacts/specs/requirements.md`
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Anchor extraction and slug generation from Markdown headings
  - String similarity algorithm for closest match suggestions
  - Efficient caching mechanism for performance optimization
  - Enhanced error reporting with actionable suggestions
- **Constraints**:
  - Must maintain existing LinkVerifier workflow
  - No breaking changes to current functionality
  - 85% minimum test coverage requirement
  - Performance optimization through caching

## VAN Analysis Results
- **Current Infrastructure**: LinkVerifier has solid foundation with anchor caching and validation
- **Integration Points**: Clear enhancement path through existing `verifyLinks` method
- **Risk Assessment**: Low risk with high user value
- **Technical Approach**: Simple character-based similarity algorithm with 0.7 threshold
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal due to existing caching system

## Current Phase Objectives
- **Phase**: IMPLEMENT (Ready for Implementation)
- **Goals**: Execute implementation according to design specifications
- **Success Criteria**: ✅ All Phases Complete
  - ✅ Clear step-by-step implementation roadmap (15 detailed items)
  - ✅ File modification strategy defined (LinkVerifier.ts enhancement)
  - ✅ Test enhancement plan established (Unit + Integration + Performance)
  - ✅ Integration with existing codebase validated (Zero breaking changes)
  - ✅ Technical design finalized with algorithm specifications
  - ✅ Edge case handling strategy defined
  - ✅ Performance and user experience validated

## PLAN Phase Results
- **Total Implementation Items**: 15 items across 4 major categories
- **Integration Strategy**: Enhance existing `verifyLinks` method (lines 54-67)
- **New Methods**: `calculateSimilarity` and `findClosestAnchor` private methods
- **Test Strategy**: Comprehensive coverage including Unicode, edge cases, performance
- **Quality Assurance**: 85% coverage target, regression prevention, performance validation

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Similarity Algorithm**: Character-based matching for simplicity and performance
- **Threshold**: 0.7 minimum similarity for quality suggestions (validated in CREATIVE)
- **Integration Strategy**: Enhance existing `verifyLinks` method without breaking changes
- **Error Reporting**: Populate `suggestions` array in BrokenLink interface
- **Caching**: Leverage existing `anchorCache` system for performance

## CREATIVE Phase Results
- **Algorithm Design**: Character-intersection approach optimized for anchor text patterns
- **Suggestion Format**: Full path format for copy-paste usability (`./page.md#valid-section`)
- **Edge Case Strategy**: Graceful handling of empty sets, no matches, Unicode text
- **Performance Design**: < 1ms per broken anchor, leverages existing caching
- **Future Enhancement Hooks**: Multiple suggestions, configurable thresholds, advanced algorithms

## Implementation Context
- **Target File**: `src/links/LinkVerifier.ts` (290 lines, well-structured)
- **Test File**: `src/links/LinkVerifier.test.ts` (835 lines, comprehensive coverage)
- **Interface**: `BrokenLink` in `src/links/types.ts` already has `suggestions: string[]`
- **Current Limitation**: Line 63 in LinkVerifier.ts - suggestions currently empty by design

## Success Validation Framework
1. **Functional**: Broken anchor reports include intelligent suggestions
2. **Performance**: Caching prevents redundant file operations
3. **Quality**: 85% test coverage with 100% success rate
4. **Compatibility**: Zero regressions in existing functionality
5. **User Experience**: Clear console feedback with actionable guidance

# Task Definition: Enhanced Anchor Validation and Reporting

**Task ID:** TASK-019
**Created:** 2025-08-03_22-58
**Status:** Active
**Phase:** QA
**Priority:** High

## Overview
Enhance the LinkVerifier to provide intelligent suggestions for broken anchor links by analyzing available anchors in target files and offering closest matches.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] LinkVerifier can read target file content and extract all valid anchor slugs
- [ ] String similarity algorithm implemented to find closest anchor matches
- [ ] Anchor cache implemented for performance optimization
- [ ] Broken anchor reports include intelligent suggestions
- [ ] Console output clearly shows invalid anchor and suggested alternatives
- [ ] Implementation follows Telegraph publisher anchor generation standards

## Task Scope
- **Files to Modify:** `src/links/LinkVerifier.ts`
- **New Features:** Anchor extraction, similarity matching, caching
- **Testing Required:** Unit tests for anchor validation and suggestions
- **Performance Impact:** Cached anchor reads for efficiency

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When processing `./page.md#invalid-sektion` with target containing `## Valid Section`, system identifies as broken
2. Suggestions array contains `./page.md#valid-section`
3. Console output displays invalid anchor and suggested valid anchor
4. Anchor cache prevents redundant file reads during single verification run
5. 85% test coverage for new anchor validation functionality
6. All tests pass with 100% success rate

## Dependencies
- Existing LinkVerifier infrastructure
- Markdown heading parsing capabilities
- String similarity algorithm implementation

## Estimated Complexity
**Medium** - Requires new algorithms but builds on existing verification infrastructure

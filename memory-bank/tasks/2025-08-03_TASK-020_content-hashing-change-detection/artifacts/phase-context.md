# Integrated Phase Context - Content Hashing for Change Detection

## User Specifications Summary
- **Source**: Technical specification provided by user in `artifacts/specs/requirements.md`
- **Key Requirements**:
  - SHA-256 content hashing excluding YAML front-matter
  - Hash comparison to skip unchanged file publication
  - Force republish flag to bypass hash check when needed
  - Hash update after successful publication operations
- **Constraints**:
  - Must maintain existing publication workflow
  - No breaking changes to current functionality
  - 85% minimum test coverage requirement
  - Performance optimization through reduced API calls

## VAN Analysis Results
- **Integration Points**: Clear enhancement paths in editWithMetadata and publishWithMetadata
- **Risk Assessment**: Low risk with high efficiency value
- **Technical Approach**: SHA-256 hashing with fail-safe fallback behavior
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal overhead (< 5ms) with significant API call reduction
- **Architecture**: Optional field addition to FileMetadata interface

## Current Phase Objectives  
- **Phase**: IMPLEMENT (Ready for Implementation)
- **Goals**: Execute implementation according to design specifications
- **Success Criteria**: ✅ All Phases Complete
  - ✅ Clear step-by-step implementation roadmap (12 detailed items)
  - ✅ File modification strategy defined (3 core files identified)  
  - ✅ Test enhancement plan established (Unit + Integration + Performance)
  - ✅ Integration with existing metadata system validated (Zero breaking changes)
  - ✅ Technical design finalized with algorithm specifications
  - ✅ Edge case handling strategy defined (fail-safe architecture)
  - ✅ Performance optimization design validated

## PLAN Phase Results
- **Total Implementation Items**: 12 items across 8 major categories
- **Integration Strategy**: Enhance FileMetadata interface and publication methods
- **Core Implementation**: calculateContentHash method and skip logic in editWithMetadata
- **Test Strategy**: Comprehensive coverage including performance and compatibility validation
- **Quality Assurance**: 85% coverage target, regression prevention, cross-platform validation

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Hashing Algorithm**: SHA-256 for cryptographic security and collision resistance
- **Hash Target**: Content excluding YAML front-matter for precise change detection
- **Integration Strategy**: Enhance existing methods without breaking changes  
- **Error Handling**: Fail-safe approach with graceful fallback to publication
- **Storage**: Hex-encoded string in existing FileMetadata interface

## CREATIVE Phase Results
- **Algorithm Design**: SHA-256 with UTF-8 processing and hex encoding
- **Skip Logic**: Early return pattern with clear user feedback  
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fail-safe architecture with graceful degradation
- **User Experience**: Clear messaging patterns with emoji icons and filename context
- **Performance**: Early exit optimization eliminating expensive operations when unchanged
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for hash calculation + integration tests for skip logic

## Implementation Context
- **Target Files**:
  - `src/types/metadata.ts` (FileMetadata interface)
  - `src/metadata/MetadataManager.ts` (serialization/parsing)
  - `src/publisher/EnhancedTelegraphPublisher.ts` (hash logic)
- **Test Files**: Unit tests for hash logic and integration tests for skip behavior
- **Integration Points**: Lines 304-354 in editWithMetadata, lines 324-341 in createMetadata
- **Current Limitation**: No change detection mechanism exists

## Success Validation Framework
1. **Functional**: Publications skipped when content unchanged
2. **Performance**: Eliminated API calls for unchanged content
3. **Quality**: 85% test coverage with 100% success rate
4. **Compatibility**: Zero regressions in existing functionality
5. **User Experience**: Clear feedback for skipped publications with force override option

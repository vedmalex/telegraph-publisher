# Requirements - Codebase Refactoring Plan

## Goals
- Improve maintainability and modularity
- Preserve external behavior and CLI UX
- Strengthen type safety and error handling
- Unify configuration handling and validation
- Enhance performance and stability

## Functional Requirements
1. CLI must use centralized token/config management via `ConfigManager`
2. CLI options must be strongly typed and validated
3. Large modules must be decomposed without changing public API
4. Unified Logger with levels; optional JSON output for automation
5. Config validation with migration path for renamed fields
6. Rate-limit manager reused across commands; no ad-hoc sleeps
7. Path normalization consistent across OS for cache/links

## Non-functional Requirements
- No regressions in existing tests; coverage â‰¥ 85%
- Backward compatible CLI flags (with deprecation guidance)
- Deterministic behavior in tests (controllable timers)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Plan and decomposition approved and documented
- Prototype of config migration and Logger integrated in one command path
- Snapshot tests for CLI help and error outputs added
- No changes to user-facing behavior in initial refactor PRs

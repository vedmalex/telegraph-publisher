# Integrated Phase Context - Codebase Refactoring Plan

## User Specifications Summary
- Source: artifacts/specs/requirements.md
- Key Requirements:
  - Centralized config/token handling
  - Strong typing for CLI options
  - Decomposition of large modules without behavior change
  - Unified Logger and error hierarchy
  - Config validation and migration
  - Performance optimizations (rate limits, paths, caches)
- Constraints:
  - No external behavior changes
  - Coverage ≥ 85%, all tests green

## Previous Phase Results
- VAN Analysis: High connectivity around CLI↔workflow↔publisher and markdown converter
- Plan Decisions: Phase execution starting from cross-cutting concerns then module decomposition
- Creative Choices: Not applicable yet

## Current Phase Objectives
- Phase: PLAN
- Goals: Produce executable refactor plan with clear milestones and acceptance criteria
- Success Criteria: Plan approved, traceability established, risk mitigations defined

## Resolved Conflicts
- None at this phase

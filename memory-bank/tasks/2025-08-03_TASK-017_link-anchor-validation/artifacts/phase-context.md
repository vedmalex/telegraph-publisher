# Integrated Phase Context - Link Anchor Validation Enhancement

## User Specifications Summary
- **Source:** Technical specification provided by user (artifacts/specs/requirements.md)
- **Key Requirements:**
  * Add anchor validation to LinkVerifier.ts
  * Parse Markdown headings and generate corresponding anchor IDs
  * Validate link fragments against actual headings in target files
  * Support Unicode/Cyrillic characters in anchors
  * Implement caching for performance optimization
- **Constraints:**
  * Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
  * Achieve 85% code coverage minimum
  * Support concurrent operations safely
  * Handle errors gracefully

## Previous Phase Results
- **VAN Analysis:** Completed successfully (analysis.md)
  * Architecture compatibility confirmed as EXCELLENT
  * Integration point identified at line 33 in verifyLinks()
  * Performance risks identified and mitigation strategies planned
  * Unicode support validated through existing test cases
  * Technical feasibility confirmed with minimal code changes required
- **Plan Decisions:** Completed successfully (plan.md)
  * 24-item hierarchical implementation plan created
  * 4-phase implementation strategy defined
  * Quality assurance checkpoints established
  * Success metrics and compliance requirements specified
- **Creative Choices:** Not yet available

## Current Phase Objectives
- **Phase:** CREATIVE (Design Decisions)
- **Goals:**
  * Make detailed design decisions for anchor validation implementation
  * Choose optimal algorithms and data structures
  * Design user experience and error handling approaches
  * Finalize technical architecture and patterns
- **Success Criteria:**
  * All algorithm details finalized and documented
  * Error handling strategy completed
  * Performance optimization approach confirmed
  * Technical design ready for direct implementation

## Resolved Conflicts
- **Performance vs. Accuracy:** Resolved through caching strategy
  * Decision: Implement Map-based caching with lazy loading
  * Rationale: Balances performance optimization with memory efficiency
- **Unicode Complexity vs. Implementation Simplicity:** Resolved through regex patterns
  * Decision: Use Unicode-aware regex patterns with proper escaping
  * Rationale: Leverages JavaScript's native Unicode support while maintaining code clarity

## Implementation Context
- **Target File:** src/links/LinkVerifier.ts
- **Integration Point:** Line 33 - `const pathWithoutFragment = link.href.split('#')[0];`
- **New Methods Required:**
  * `generateSlug(text: string): string` - convert headings to URL-friendly slugs
  * `getAnchorsForFile(filePath: string): Set<string>` - extract and cache anchors from files
- **Method to Modify:** `verifyLinks()` - add anchor validation logic
- **New Dependencies:** `readFileSync` from fs module
- **Cache Structure:** `Map<string, Set<string>>` for anchor caching by file path
- **Testing Requirements:** Enhanced test suite with Unicode/Cyrillic support and performance benchmarks

## Technical Design Context
- **Architecture Pattern:** Extension of existing verification pipeline
- **Error Handling Pattern:** Graceful degradation (return empty Set on file read errors)
- **Performance Pattern:** Lazy-loaded caching with Map-based storage
- **Testing Pattern:** Comprehensive unit, integration, and regression testing
- **Unicode Pattern:** Native JavaScript Unicode support with proper regex flags

# Task: Persistent Anchor Caching

**Task ID:** 2025-08-04_TASK-029_persistent-anchor-caching
**Created:** 2025-08-04 20:29
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Phase:** QA Phase → COMPLETE

## Description

✅ **SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED** persistent file-based caching for anchor validation to significantly improve performance of repeated link checking operations. The system caches analyzed anchors in a `.telegraph-anchors-cache.json` file and uses content hash validation to invalidate cache entries only when files have changed.

## Key Objectives

1. ✅ **Performance Enhancement**: Achieved - Reduced link checking time by avoiding re-analysis of unchanged files
2. ✅ **Persistent Caching**: Implemented - File-based cache that persists between application runs
3. ✅ **Smart Invalidation**: Working - SHA-256 content hash comparison detects file changes
4. ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Verified - All existing functionality preserved with optional enhancements

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Create `AnchorCacheManager` class for managing persistent anchor cache
- ✅ Implement `.telegraph-anchors-cache.json` file format with versioning
- ✅ Move `calculateContentHash` to `ContentProcessor` as shared utility
- ✅ Update `LinkVerifier` to use persistent cache with hash-based invalidation
- ✅ Maintain accurate error messages with available anchors list
- ✅ Achieve significant performance improvement for repeat operations
- ✅ Ensure 85% code coverage and 100% test success rate

## Technical Requirements

- File-based cache using JSON format
- SHA-256 content hash for change detection
- Automatic cache invalidation for modified files
- Graceful fallback when cache is corrupted or unavailable
- Thread-safe cache operations
- Proper error handling and logging

## Dependencies

- Existing `LinkVerifier` functionality
- `MetadataManager` for content processing
- File system operations for cache persistence
- Content hashing utilities

## Notes

This enhancement builds upon the existing anchor validation system, adding persistent caching to dramatically improve performance in real-world usage scenarios where users repeatedly check links in large documentation projects.

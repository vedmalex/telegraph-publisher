# Integrated Phase Context - Persistent Anchor Caching

## User Specifications Summary
- Source: artifacts/specs/requirements.md
- Key Requirements: 
  - Implement persistent file-based caching for anchor validation
  - Create AnchorCacheManager class for cache management
  - Use SHA-256 content hash for change detection and cache invalidation
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing LinkVerifier functionality
  - Achieve significant performance improvement for repeat operations
- Constraints: 
  - Must maintain 85% code coverage and 100% test success rate
  - Must preserve existing error message functionality
  - Must handle corrupted cache gracefully
  - Must work without cache (fallback mode)

## Previous Phase Results
- VAN Analysis: ✅ COMPLETED - Comprehensive analysis of current architecture, integration points, and technical feasibility
- Plan Decisions: ✅ COMPLETED - Detailed hierarchical implementation plan with 23 tasks across 5 major phases  
- Creative Choices: ✅ COMPLETED - Advanced architectural design with intelligent caching, adaptive strategies, and performance optimization
- Implementation: ✅ COMPLETED - Full system implementation with persistent anchor caching

## Current Phase Objectives
- Phase: QA Phase → COMPLETE
- Goals: ✅ COMPLETED - Successfully implemented and QA validated persistent anchor caching system
- Success Criteria: ✅ ALL MET
  - ✅ AnchorCacheManager class created with full functionality
  - ✅ ContentProcessor enhanced with centralized hash calculation
  - ✅ LinkVerifier integrated with cache system and fallback
  - ✅ .telegraph-anchors-cache.json format implemented with versioning
  - ✅ Cache invalidation working with SHA-256 content hashing
  - ✅ Graceful error handling and backward compatibility preserved
  - ✅ Comprehensive test coverage with unit and integration tests
  - ✅ Performance improvement verified with cache effectiveness
  - ✅ All 11 requirements successfully implemented and tested

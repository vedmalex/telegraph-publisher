# Task Definition - Content Hash Backfilling for Published Dependencies

**Task ID:** 2025-08-04_TASK-025_hash-backfill-published-deps
**Created:** 2025-08-04_13-06
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Active - VAN Phase
**Priority:** High
**Category:** Enhancement

## Task Overview
Implement automatic content hash backfilling for already published dependencies that lack contentHash metadata. This addresses a critical gap where published files without contentHash are "stuck" and never get the hash needed for smart republishing functionality.

## Problem Statement
During the dependency publishing process, files that are already published but do not have a `contentHash` in their metadata are ignored. This prevents them from being updated with a hash, effectively disabling the change-detection mechanism for those files in all future publications.

## User's Goal
The system must identify any published dependency that is missing a `contentHash` and trigger a one-time "edit" operation to update its content and, most importantly, add the `contentHash` to its metadata.

## Root Cause Analysis
The logic in `EnhancedTelegraphPublisher.ts`, specifically within the `publishDependencies` method, focuses primarily on identifying and publishing *unpublished* files. It does not have a specific check for published files that need a metadata upgrade (i.e., adding the `contentHash`).

## Success Criteria
1. âœ… System automatically detects published dependencies missing contentHash
2. âœ… `publishDependencies` method processes ALL files in dependency tree, not just unpublished ones
3. âœ… Published files without contentHash trigger automatic `editWithMetadata` call
4. âœ… Files with existing contentHash and unchanged content are skipped
5. âœ… New unpublished dependencies continue to work as before
6. âœ… Comprehensive test coverage for new backfilling logic
7. âœ… 85% minimum code coverage maintained
8. âœ… 100% test success rate

## Technical Requirements
- **File to Modify:** `src/publisher/EnhancedTelegraphPublisher.ts`
- **Method to Modify:** `publishDependencies`
- **Core Logic:** Change iteration from `filesToPublish` to `analysis.publishOrder`
- **New Condition:** Check published files for missing contentHash
- **Force Update:** Use `editWithMetadata` with `forceRepublish: true`

## Acceptance Test Scenario
1. Create `root.md` (unpublished) that references `dep1.md` and `dep2.md`
2. `dep1.md` is published but lacks contentHash in metadata
3. `dep2.md` is published with contentHash and unchanged content
4. Running `publish` on `root.md` should:
   - Automatically update `dep1.md` with contentHash via `editWithMetadata`
   - Skip `dep2.md` (unchanged)
   - Publish `root.md` normally

## Dependencies
- Current `EnhancedTelegraphPublisher.ts` implementation
- `MetadataManager` for status and metadata checks
- Existing `editWithMetadata` and `publishWithMetadata` methods

## Estimated Complexity
**Medium-High** - Requires careful modification of core publishing logic with comprehensive testing

## Quality Standards
- English code and comments only
- 2-space indentation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Unit tests with mocking for API calls
- Integration with existing metadata system

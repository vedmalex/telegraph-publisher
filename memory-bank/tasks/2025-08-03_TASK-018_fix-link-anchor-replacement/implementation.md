# Implementation Log - Fix Link Anchor Replacement

**Task ID:** TASK-018
**Phase:** IMPLEMENT
**Date:** 2025-08-03_22-31
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
- ✅ **Completed** - Implement anchor preservation logic in ContentProcessor.ts
- ✅ **Completed** - Add comprehensive test cases
- ✅ **Completed** - Validate test coverage and functionality

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Core Logic Implementation
**File Modified:** `src/content/ContentProcessor.ts`
**Method:** `replaceLinksInContent` (lines 156-178)

**Key Changes:**
- Added logic to extract file path without anchor from `resolvedPath` for lookup in `linkMappings`
- Implemented anchor detection and preservation from `originalPath`
- Modified Telegraph URL construction to append anchors when present
- Updated both `replacementMap` and `link.telegraphUrl` with complete URLs including anchors

**Code Added:**
```typescript
// Extract file path without anchor from resolvedPath for lookup in linkMappings
const anchorIndex = link.resolvedPath.indexOf('#');
const filePathOnly = anchorIndex !== -1 ? link.resolvedPath.substring(0, anchorIndex) : link.resolvedPath;

const telegraphUrl = linkMappings.get(filePathOnly);
if (telegraphUrl) {
  // Check for and preserve the URL fragment (anchor) from original path
  const originalAnchorIndex = link.originalPath.indexOf('#');
  let finalUrl = telegraphUrl;

  if (originalAnchorIndex !== -1) {
    const anchor = link.originalPath.substring(originalAnchorIndex);
    finalUrl += anchor;
  }

  // Use the final URL (with anchor) for replacement
  replacementMap.set(link.originalPath, finalUrl);
  link.telegraphUrl = finalUrl;
  link.isPublished = true;
}
```

### 2. Comprehensive Test Suite
**File Modified:** `src/content/ContentProcessor.test.ts`
**Tests Added:** 5 new test cases covering all anchor scenarios

**Test Cases Implemented:**
1. **Basic Anchor Preservation:** Links with anchors correctly preserve fragments
2. **Mixed Links:** Content with both anchor and non-anchor links handled correctly
3. **Cyrillic Characters:** Unicode anchors properly preserved
4. **Edge Cases:** Empty anchors and multiple hash symbols handled gracefully
5. **Unpublished Files:** Anchors preserved for files not in linkMappings

### 3. Quality Validation

**Test Results:**
- All 35 ContentProcessor tests pass ✅
- All 334 project tests pass ✅
- No regressions introduced ✅

**Code Coverage:**
- ContentProcessor: 92.63% line coverage (exceeds 85% requirement) ✅
- Function coverage: 88.89% ✅

## Problem Resolution Verification

**Original Issue:** Links like `[text](./page.md#section)` were being replaced with `https://telegra.ph/page` (anchor lost)

**Fixed Behavior:** Same links now correctly replaced with `https://telegra.ph/page#section` (anchor preserved)

**Root Cause:** `linkMappings.get(link.resolvedPath)` failed when `resolvedPath` included anchors, as mappings only contained file paths without anchors.

**Solution:** Extract file path without anchor from `resolvedPath` for lookup, then append original anchor to Telegraph URL.
